# MAX31865

## Description

The MAX31865 is a resistance sensor, which primarily used in combination with a resistance temperature detectors (RTD).
As their temperature changes, the resistance of the RTD changes, which can be measured and used to calculate the
temperature. This board measures only the resistance, but the internal logic of PhyPiDAQ is adjusted for Platinum RTDs.

There are two kinds of Platinum RTDs, the PT100 and the PT1000, where the PT100 has an internal resistance of 100 Ohm
and the PT1000 has an internal resistance of 1000 Ohm. The MAX31865 is able to handle both options, but it needs a
matching reference resistor of 430 Ohm for PT100 and 4300 Ohm for the PT1000. As the reference resistor comes mostly
soldered on the board of the MAX31865, ensure that you have a matching pair of your reference resistor (board) and your
Platinum RTD.

Supported channels:

- Resistance
- Temperature (calculated)
