# ADS1115 four-channel 16 bit analog-to-digital converter

## Description

The ADS1155 a very versatile, high-resolution digital-to-analog converter with an internal, programmable amplifier and  an I²C interface. six input ranges from ±0.256 V to ±6.144 V
are possible; however, input voltages must not exceed  the operation Voltage, i.e. 0 V to 
a maximum of 5.5 V. As a special feature, pairs of inputs can be used in differential mode.
The sampling frequency is programmable in 8 steps  with a maximum of 860 samples/s.

The full capabilities are best illustrated by the *yaml* configuration:

## Requirements

The sensor is supported by the library *adafruit-circuitpython-ads1x15*.

## Experience

The ADS1115 is a true working-horse for measuring voltages with high precision, albeit
with limited sampling frequency. It can be complemented with additional pre-amplifiers like 
an  instrumentation or electrometer amplifier to cover a large range of measurements in the
physics lab.
